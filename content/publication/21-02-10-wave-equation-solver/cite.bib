  abstract =     {In the last few years, several quantum algorithms
                  that try to address the problem of partial
                  differential equation solving have been devised: on
                  the one hand, “direct” quantum algorithms that aim
                  at encoding the solution of the PDE by executing one
                  large quantum circuit; on the other hand,
                  variational algorithms that approximate the solution
                  of the PDE by executing several small quantum
                  circuits and making profit of classical
                  optimisers. In this work, we propose an experimental
                  study of the costs (in terms of gate number and
                  execution time on a idealised hardware created from
                  realistic gate data) associated with one of the
                  “direct” quantum algorithm: the wave equation solver
                  devised in [32]. We show that our implementation of
                  the quantum wave equation solver agrees with the
                  theoretical big-O complexity of the algorithm. We
                  also explain in great detail the implementation
                  steps and discuss some possibilities of
                  improvements. Finally, our implementation proves
                  experimentally that some PDE can be solved on a
                  quantum computer, even if the direct quantum
                  algorithm chosen will require error-corrected
                  quantum chips, which are not believed to be
                  available in the short-term.},
